## 🚀 Project Summary

In this project, I take on the role of a **market research analyst** for **Cardio Good Fitness**, a retail company selling treadmills.  
The goal is to understand whether customer characteristics differ across treadmill product lines using data-driven analysis.

The dataset includes customer demographics, product types, income, usage patterns and health indicators, allowing a deep dive into customer behaviour and purchasing patterns.  

This assignment highlights my strengths in:  
- Programmatic data cleaning and wrangling  
- Univariate and multivariate exploratory analysis  
- Visual storytelling using Python libraries  
- Dashboard creation for business-facing presentations  
- Designing targeted insights that support decision-making

### ❓ Exploratory & Declarative Questions  
Developed meaningful business questions aligned to stakeholder goals, such as:  
- How do customer demographics differ across treadmill models?  
- Which product line attracts higher-income buyers?  
- Is there a relationship between fitness level and treadmill usage?  
- Do miles-per-week differ by product line or branch location?  
- Are certain branches linked to distinct customer profiles?

### 📊 Visualisations  
Created multiple visualisations using Python to answer exploratory questions:  
- Histograms, bar charts and boxplots for univariate analysis  
- Scatterplots and pairplots for multivariate relationships  
- Grouped comparisons to uncover differences across product lines  
- Correlation heatmaps to identify key variables  
- Enhanced visuals with clear labels, colour consistency and design principles

Each visualisation includes:  
- The business question it answers  
- Justification of the chosen chart type  
- Interpretation of the insights  

### 🖥️ Dashboard Creation  
From the library of visualisations, I designed **multiple dashboards**, each focused on a single theme, such as:  
- Customer demographics  
- Product line differences  
- Income and usage behaviour  
- Fitness and performance metrics  


Deliverables include:  
- Fully executed Jupyter Notebook  
- All visualisations and dashboards  
- Presentation video link embedded at the top of the notebook
